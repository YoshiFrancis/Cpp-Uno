Hello and welcome to Francis's wonderful UNO game!!! The order of players shall depend on the order on which they joined.
There is no fixed deck, so you cannot count any cards since all draws will be randomized! A winner shall be declared once they have
gained a hand of 0 cards. Let the best player win!!!
